# üìä **DAD Projects: Data Access and Analysis**

Hello there! I'm **Nicholas Wyrwas**, a **Software Engineering Student** with a passion for data and how we can use it to drive decisions and insights. In this repository, I‚Äôve gathered a collection of **datasets** and **SQL queries** that I‚Äôve created or worked with, which I believe can help you simplify the process of **data access and analysis**. Whether you're a student, professional, or a company looking to analyze your data efficiently, you'll find useful resources here.

## üìÇ **Datasets Overview**

Throughout my studies and professional experience, I've curated datasets from a variety of industries and domains. These datasets represent real-world data across multiple business functions and use cases. Here are the types of datasets available in this repository:

### **1. Sales Data**
- **Purpose**: Analyze performance, trends, and customer behavior.
- **Contents**: Includes transaction records, product details, customer segments, and sales data over time.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Identify top-performing products and categories.
  - Measure sales trends over time and across different regions.
  - Analyze customer purchasing patterns to drive marketing strategies.

### **2. Employee Data**
- **Purpose**: Explore employee demographics, salaries, and performance metrics.
- **Contents**: Contains information about employees, including their job titles, departments, salary, tenure, performance evaluations, and promotions.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Calculate average salaries across departments and regions.
  - Analyze employee turnover rates and retention factors.
  - Assess performance metrics to identify high-potential employees.

### **3. Product Inventory**
- **Purpose**: Track inventory levels, product sales, and supplier details.
- **Contents**: Provides data on product IDs, stock levels, product prices, suppliers, and sales over time.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Monitor stock levels to ensure inventory is sufficient.
  - Identify best-selling products and track restocking needs.
  - Assess supplier performance and delivery times.

### **4. Customer Feedback**
- **Purpose**: Dive into customer feedback sentiments and satisfaction scores.
- **Contents**: Contains feedback surveys, ratings, customer satisfaction scores, and sentiment analysis data.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Perform sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction.
  - Identify common issues and areas for improvement based on feedback.
  - Correlate feedback with product or service quality.

## üîç **SQL Queries**

To analyze the datasets above and uncover valuable insights, I‚Äôve written various SQL queries. These queries serve different purposes, ranging from basic data retrieval to complex analytics. Here‚Äôs a summary of the types of queries available in this repository:

### **1. Basic Data Retrieval**
- Simple SQL queries designed to retrieve specific data from individual tables.
- **Example**: 
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM sales_data WHERE product_id = 101;

  ```

  ### **2. Aggregated Analysis**
Queries that calculate summary statistics or aggregated values across datasets, such as total sales, average employee salaries, or average customer ratings.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT product_id, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales 
FROM sales_data 
GROUP BY product_id;
```
### **3. Advanced Analytics
- Complex SQL queries used for in-depth analysis such as cohort analysis, trend analysis, or advanced filtering techniques.
- **Example**:
  ```sql

  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31'
  GROUP BY customer_id
  HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 5;

  ```
### **4. Join Operations**
Queries that combine data from multiple tables to perform comprehensive analysis.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, s.salary 
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id;

```
  ### **5. Trend and Time-Series Analysis**
SQL queries designed to extract insights from data over time, like sales trends, monthly growth, or seasonal variations.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT MONTH(order_date) AS month, SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY month;
```
### **üîß Technologies Used**
These datasets and SQL queries were built with and can be used in various relational databases and platforms:

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite** (Database platforms)
- **Microsoft SQL Server** (For Enterprise-grade solutions)
- **Excel / Google Sheets** (For initial data exploration and analysis)

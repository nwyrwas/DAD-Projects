Hi there! I'm Nicholas Wyrwas, a data enthusiast passionate about simplifying data access and analysis through my experience as a Software Engineering Student. In this repository, you'll find datasets and SQL queries that I have used to help employers review and analyze data efficiently.

Datasets
I've curated datasets covering various industries and domains, including:

Sales Data: Analyze sales performance, trends, and customer behavior.

Employee Data: Explore employee demographics, salaries, and performance metrics.

Product Inventory: Track inventory levels, product sales, and supplier details.

Customer Feedback: Dive into customer feedback sentiments and satisfaction scores.

SQL Queries
I've written SQL queries to extract valuable insights from these datasets. You'll find queries for:

Basic Data Retrieval: Simple queries to retrieve data from specific tables.
Aggregated Analysis: Queries to calculate summary statistics, such as total sales, average salaries, etc.
Advanced Analytics: Complex queries for trend analysis, cohort analysis, and more.
